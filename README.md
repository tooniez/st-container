## Introduction

This project uses Docker and Docker Compose to manage the development and deployment process of a containerized Streamlit app. The Makefile provides convenient commands to manage the Docker container.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Make

## Available Commands

The following commands are available through the Makefile:

### `make all`

This is the default command that runs the following sequence:
1. Stops the existing container
2. Rebuilds the Docker image
3. Runs the rebuilt container

### `make stop`

Stops and removes the Docker container.

### `make build`

Rebuilds the Docker image without using cache.

### `make run`

Runs the rebuilt Docker container in detached mode.

### `make remove`

Removes the Docker image.

## Usage

To use these commands, simply run `make all` followed by the command name. For example:


This will execute the default sequence of stopping the container, rebuilding the image, and running the rebuilt container.

## Docker Compose Configuration

The project uses a Docker Compose configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`) to define the service. The main service is named `st-container`.

## Customization

You can modify the Makefile to add more commands or adjust the existing ones according to your project needs.
